    "There is a saying that synthetic chemists spend 10% of their time running reactions and 90% of their time purifying compounds. A similar saying could be jokingly said that working with chemical data is 10% performing the intended calculations or analyses on the data and 90% of the time cleaning and organizing the data. While these are both hyperbole, they underline the large amount of effort required to clean materials. This chapter is dedicated to a powerful methods known as **regular expressions**, or **regex** for short, for cleaning and filtering data, especially in situations requiring complex pattern matching. Python [string methods](1.3.3) and [indexing](1.3.2) offer basic search and filtering functionality, but they tend to only allow for identifying simple and consistent patterns. For example, if you want a file name without the file extension (e.g., *titration* from *titration.png*), this can be solved using indexing and the string `split()` method because the file extensions always follow the last period in the full file name. Likewise, parsing data from a [PDB file](16.2.1) can be parsed with only a string search and slicing because PDB files follow very strict formatting rules based on labels and positions in rows. However, not all data follow well-defined formatting rules or there could be more variation that needs to be accounted for. An example that will be addressed below is filting data for Chemical Abstrac Service registration numbers (CAS) numbers which look like 100-53-8 and 172222-30-9 and have have varying lengths.  The good news is that this is a relatively simple task for regular expressions because regular expressions can differentiate between digits, letters, and symbols and provides the ability to seek varying numbers of characters. Regular expressions is not strictly a Python feature but rather is a syntax supported by Python using the `re` module imported below. This module is a built-in Python module, so it comes with every installation of Python."

    "\n",
    "Let's now do some extra examples. When downloading data files from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the CAS number is mixed in with other names and numberical identifiers. There are two challenges here. The first is that CAS numbers vary in length. They are always three segments of numbers separated by hyphens, such as 58-08-2 or 2501-94-2, where the second segment is always two digits and the thirds is always a single digit. However the first segment varies from 2-7 digits. The second major issue is that the CAS numbers are mixed in with other chemical identifiers such as CID numbers, common names, and IUPAC names. These other identifiers can include hyphens and numbers, so indexing and string searches cannot easily filter for CAS numbers without a long series of boolean conditions. \n",
